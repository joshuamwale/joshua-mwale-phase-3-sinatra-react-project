Project Details:

This project is titled: Phase 3 Sinatra and React Project. It entails the building of a web basic Application Programming Interface(API) with Sinatra and Active Record. It the building of a backend that will support a React frontend that is I have built seprately. 

This is an independent project build by Joshua Anyangu Mwale build as part of my Phase 3 progress requirements. 

Description:
In this project I have build a Sinatra API backend that uses an ORM called Active Record to access and persist data in a database. I have focused on building two models that bring out a one-to-many relationship. I have the owners model and  the appartments model. An owner has many apartments and an appartment belongs  to an owner. 

I have used Sinatra to set up several API routes that can be implemented on apartments model. Some of the actions that a user of the application can act on the database include create an apartment, read a list of apartments, and delete an apartment. This backend enables a separately created React frontend to perform the three CRUD actions. 

Deployment and live link:
I have deployed this backend on Heroku to enable continous integration and continous deployment(CI/CD) model of software development.
